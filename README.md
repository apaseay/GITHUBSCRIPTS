# GitHub Account Switcher (Windows, macOS & Linux)

## Overview

This project provides cross-platform scripts to automate switching between multiple GitHub accounts, such as a personal and a college/work account.

It ensures each commit and push uses the correct account identity, preventing unintentional contributions from another GitHub profile.

### Background

During development work, I discovered that my **college GitHub account appeared as a contributor** to my **personal repository**, even though I had authenticated using my personal account through `gh auth login` and browser authentication.

After researching, I learned that GitHub prioritizes the identity stored in **Git configuration (`user.name` and `user.email`)** over authentication tokens when making commits.

This means that even if you log in through the browser as one account, Git will still push commits under the **last configured identity**.

This project was created to automate that process, ensuring that Git and GitHub CLI (`gh`) always match the correct account before every push.
